# Covid-19 Predictor with respect to symptoms
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose a critical and urgent threat to global health. The outbreak in early December 2019 in the Hubei province of the People’s Republic of China has spread worldwide. As of October 2020, the overall number of patients confirmed to have the disease has exceeded 39,500,000, in >180 countries, though the number of people infected is probably much higher. More than 1,110,000 people have died from COVID-19.

## Problem Statement
COVID testing is costly and risky. Also there are asymptomatic covid patients who don’t realise that they are covid positive. Some people neglect their early symptoms or mistake them for some common flu or other disease.

## Proposed Solution
I propose a machine-learning model using Decision tree algorithm that predicts a positive COVID infection by asking twenty basic questions. The model was trained on data of all individuals tested for COVID during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, my model can be implemented globally for effective screening and prioritization of testing for the virus in the general population.

## Result
This code includes a graphical user interface that is simple and user friendly from which person can choose whether they are having the symptoms or have done a certain activity or not and the AI can predict if he/she is COVID positive or not. There may be some error in predicting after all it is artificial intelligence. It is recommended to consult a doctor but this can surely help in roughly estimating if you are covid positive or negative.

## Conclusion
Hence AI model was successfully implemented to predict whether the patient is covid positive or negative. This can reduce the chance of further spread of virus and can reduce severity and save live by alerting the patient at an early stage.
